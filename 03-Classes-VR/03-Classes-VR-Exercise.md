# Exercise: Classes Model Virtual Reality

## Tasks

Run the unit test already written in the `03-Classes-VR-UnitTests` project. 

Your exercise:

1. write this unit test for `class Deck`, which exercises a proper protocol for 
   deck use:

   create a deck object, then deal and print two dozen cards

2. write this unit test for `class Hand`, which exercises a proper protocol:

   create a deck object and a hand object, 
   deal 5 cards to hand object, then display (write) the hand's cards

3. write the missing code for method  `BJScore`  in  `class Hand` and 
   and write a unit test for it
   
   (For now, assume an Ace always has value of 1.)   

4. run the Visual Studio coverage analysis and look at its result to see which
   code that is not covered by the unit tests above
